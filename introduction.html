        <h2 id="titlecenter">What's the idea behind this lore?</h2>
        <p>Around 2014 I had the idea of making a harem manga, but done in a way that didn't feel like a collection of cliches of other animes.</p>
        <p>The core idea was initially a type of story where a hero is stranded in some hostile planet, after his colonizer ship had a fatal crash and only his escape capsule and the harem survived, so he had an array of diferent cultures girls to protect and survive in that new place.</p>
        <p>Similar to Robinson crusoe type of survival stories in a remote island. But with a bit sci fi setting, to logically explain why an international cast of girls would be in that place.</p>
        <p>I couldn't make it back then, because I lacked the skills to make it properly.</p>
        <p>I later realized I could make it as a videogame, so my idea naturally evolved to become more a videogame setting.</p>
        <p>I later, eventually realized I wanted to make an erotic game, but with a really strong story, something I did not see a lot that hentai animes never explored.</p>
        <p>I'm first influenced by manga and videogames first, and secondary I've been influenced by classical culture.</p>
        <p>So my goal is to make something that feels a lot like generic animes, but without the issues of tired tropes in that medium.</p>
        <p>Eventually the idea evolved later around 2020, about making an adult erotic monster catcher and monster trainer type of rpg.</p>
        <p>The idea initially was more like, wouldn't be cool if I made a setting where an MC appears in a new world and he's the only male in a world filled with female npcs, female monsters and female villains.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't be cool if you could capture not only the monsters, but also the villagers and villains using some capture mechanic, similar to a magical card system, where the female npc or monster is sealed into your harem deck.</p>
        <p>And eventually, imagine if you could summon these cards as assist in battle to fight other monsters or hit the npcs to capture them?</p>
        <p>I keep thinking, and I was at some point, that this will make a solid harem adult videogame.</p>
        <p>So, the idea evolved around those mental seeds.</p>
        <h2 id="titlecenter">But why an international cast? </h2>
        <p>I'm from a culture that is usually not represented a lot in anime or games, so I eventually started to think about this issue.</p>
        <p>Also, I like to learn, so learning about other cultures was a natural fit for my own mindset. I like to learn about new concepts and ideas that other civilizations on this planet have.</p>
